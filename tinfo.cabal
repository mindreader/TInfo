-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            Show metadata from a torrent file

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         Simple terminal program to display info about a torrent file.
                     What I'm using it for: lookup lesspipe.sh for gentoo,
                     set the LESSOPEN environment variable to '|lesspipe.sh %s',
                     and set tinfo in place of the default torrentinfo program
                     and when you less a torrent file you will get a readable
                     version of it.
